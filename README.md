# EckardBankAndTrust

Written   1/8/2026

## Description
This program is an extension of a C++ college course programming problem that asked the programmer to create multiple structures of
"Bank Customers" and the ability to edit customer information. I took this programming problem and expanded it to be a UI-driven
application for a self-service banking app that would be used in a kiosk in a physical bank. I am using this as my Programming Capstone Project.

The program has the following main functions:
- Log In Screen with hidden password
- Ability to create a new account
- Able to deposit and withdraw money
- Edit customer information
- Export customer information to .txt file

## Technologies Used
- VB.NET
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
- Framework net8.0-windows

## How to Run


## *NOTE*
I am very new to Github and am learning as I go, so please be patient with me.
